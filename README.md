Comfortable Nether Workspace
Rules of forking permissions:

You cannot use the assets or workspace until I give permission.
If you are given access to fork the mod, do not share the mod workspace with others for them to make their own forks.  If they want to do that, they too will need my permission.
When you make the fork public, credit me somewhere in the page or mod itself, I'm really lenient on that.
Using models, items, or other workspace content and putting them in other mods is prohibited.
You don't have to make me as owner or any member of the new mod page.
Once you get the fork, it is all yours to edit and you do not have to ask me what content you want to add or version you want to port to.  I do hope that you stay true to how it's supposed to work and what it represents, though you don't have to oblige to that hope.
